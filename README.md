# Lol Player Search

A simple React.js project that makes requests to Riot's API and returns some data about the searched summoner. <br> <br>
Made just for learning React.js and training the use of external APIs.

This product is not endorsed, certified or otherwise approved in any way by Riot Games, Inc. or any of its affiliates.

## Use:

After cloning project, open terminal in project directory and run: <br>

`npm install`

Get your api key from Riot Developer Portal and replace `YOUR API_KEY RIGHT HERE` with your own api_key on line 8 of `App.js`

After changing api key now you can run project:

`npm start`

and project will run on `localhost:3030`.

## Observations:

It might be useful to change on `line 11` of `App.js` the address for your region.\
Not sure if this is necessary.
